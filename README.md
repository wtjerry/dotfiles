# dot files
This project contains a collection of configuration files to setup a Linux system to my liking.
Altough it may also work for other systems, these configurations are only tested on Debian and Arch Linux.

## Usage
In your $HOME do 
```sh 
git clone <this-repo> . 
```

## Necessary manual steps
The following steps are necessary to make certain tools work as intended.
In the future they may be automated. (famous last words of a programmer)

### keyboard layout
The german keyboards have a somewhat necessary annoyance that to get any of the 3 characters ````, ^ or ~ you need to press the key twice (or follow it up with a space).
That's to allow the typing of accented characters like Ã£.
To disable that behaviour you may choose the layout ".. no dead keys".

### clone base16
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell.git ~/.config/base16-shell
    ```

### zsh
1. Clone zplug
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/zplug/zplug .zplug
    ```
2. Install all zsh plugins if this was not already done automatically
    ``` 
    zplug install 
    ```

3. Change to your prefered theme (my choice: solarflare)
    ```
    base16_<your-prefered-theme>
    ```

### vim
Either use a version of vi compiled with the flags that supports the inline windows coc uses (nox vim) or use neovim.
1. download https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug and copy it to either ~/.vim/autoload (normal vim) or ~/.config/nvim/autload
2. Install all vim plugins
    ``` 
    :PlugInstall 
    ```

3. Adapt the theme if required. If you chose material-darker you may want to change color08 / Bright Black to "90/90/90" to make comments etc more visible. File to adapt: $HOME/.config/base16-shell/scripts/base16- <your-prefered-theme> .sh
